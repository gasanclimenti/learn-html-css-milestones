  <h1>HTML and CSS!</h1>
  <p>This is an example of some things I've learned so far in DIG-245.</p>
  <p>Before this class, I had never used much HTML or CSS. Now I know a lot more!</p>

  <h2>What's happening now?</h2>
  <p>Right now, it's 6:00 on Tuesday, October 18, and I'm listening to So. Central Rain by R.E.M.</p>
  <p>Before that, The Great Beyond and Driver 8 played.</p>
  <p>I like Radio Free Europe the best.</p>
